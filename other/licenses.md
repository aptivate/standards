In July 2012 we agreed that our default license would be GPL v3.  I can't find a place that decision was recorded, but you can see the [meeting agenda](https://wiki.aptivate.org/Wiki.jsp?page=MonthlyMeetingMinutes.7thJuly2011) and [photo of the accepted proposal](https://wiki.aptivate.org/attach/MonthlyMeetingMinutes.7thJuly2011/License.jpg).  There is also an [econsensus discussion about the license for Alfie](https://econsensus.org/item/detail/341/).
